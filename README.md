# The function of a MIDI controller that you can play minigames and piano
A MIDI controller that combines playing mini-games and piano with the goal of promoting good health and well-being serves several important functions. First and foremost, playing the piano on the MIDI controller allows users to engage in music therapy, which has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Creating melodies and harmonies can promote relaxation and emotional well-being. Besides that, mini-games offer a form of mindful distraction, allowing users to temporarily shift their focus away from stressors or negative thoughts. This can promote mental clarity and reduce mental fatigue. Lastly, both piano playing and mini-games require cognitive engagement, such as hand-eye coordination, memory, and problem-solving. Regular cognitive stimulation can help maintain and improve cognitive function, especially as people age.
